# ETL-process-with-py7zr
ETL process with the help of py7zr to extract the files from multiple zip files and then uploading them to s3 bucket in the same pattern
So here there are some files which are '7zip' files that requires password to extract (Note: password is given in ipynb file)
now that file contains zip folders and also inside that folder there are some files 
so we have to upload all the files and folders in the same pattern in our s3 bucket using boto3
